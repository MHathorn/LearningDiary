# Week 7: Classification - The Big Questions

## Summary

This week we continued with more classification algorithms in GEE. We focused on object-based image analysis and sub-pixel analysis, which I will describe below.

### Object-based Image Analysis

This uses a clustering algorithm -- one of the most common is Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) -- to identify areas that are similar to each other and create shapes of similar (homogeneous) or different (heterogeneous) 'superpixels'.

### Sub-pixel Analysis

This determines the proportion of each landcover type per pixel. Essentially, it works by comparing the reflectance values in each pixel to the 'ideal' values of a spectrally pure endmember for that landcover class -- these values are arrived at through **LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS OR??**

### Accuracy

There are a number of ways to measure the accuracy of a model in remote sensing and machine learning. Which measure (or combination of measures) you choose depends on the application.

Binary confusion matrix

Users accuracy/precision

Producer's accuracy (recall)

F1 Score

ROC Score

Train test split

CV

WATCH OUT FOR SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION IN REMOTELY SENSED DATA - need to keep training and testing data far apart
