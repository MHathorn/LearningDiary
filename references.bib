  abstract = {Abstract             Unlike satellite images, which are typically acquired and processed in near-real-time, global land cover products have historically been produced on an annual basis, often with substantial lag times between image processing and dataset release. We developed a new automated approach for globally consistent, high resolution, near real-time (NRT) land use land cover (LULC) classification leveraging deep learning on 10\,m Sentinel-2 imagery. We utilize a highly scalable cloud-based system to apply this approach and provide an open, continuous feed of LULC predictions in parallel with Sentinel-2 acquisitions. This first-of-its-kind NRT product, which we collectively refer to as Dynamic World, accommodates a variety of user needs ranging from extremely up-to-date LULC data to custom global composites representing user-specified date ranges. Furthermore, the continuous nature of the product's outputs enables refinement, extension, and even redefinition of the LULC classification. In combination, these unique attributes enable unprecedented flexibility for a diverse community of users across a variety of disciplines.},

  abstract = {Urban flooding is one of the most costly and destructive natural hazards worldwide. Remote-sensing images with high temporal resolutions have been extensively applied to timely inundation monitoring, assessing and mapping, but are limited by their low spatial resolution. Sub-pixel mapping has drawn great attention among researchers worldwide and has demonstrated a promising potential of high-accuracy mapping of inundation. Aimed to boost sub-pixel urban inundation mapping (SUIM) from remote-sensing imagery, a new algorithm based on spatial attraction models and Elman neural networks (SAMENN) was developed and examined in this paper. The Elman neural networks (ENN)-based SUIM module was developed firstly. Then a normalized edge intensity index of mixed pixels was generated. Finally the algorithm of SAMENN-SUIM was constructed and implemented. Landsat 8 images of two cities of China, which experienced heavy floods, were used in the experiments. Compared to three traditional SUIM methods, SAMENN-SUIM attained higher mapping accuracy according not only to visual evaluations but also quantitative assessments. The effects of normalized edge intensity index threshold and neuron number of the hidden layer on accuracy of the SAMENN-SUIM algorithm were analyzed and discussed. The newly developed algorithm in this study made a positive contribution to advancing urban inundation mapping from remote-sensing images with medium-low spatial resolutions, and hence can favor urban flood monitoring and risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Mapping informal settlements' diverse morphological patterns remains intricate due to the unavailability and huge costs of high-resolution data, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of urban environments. The accessibility to high-spatial-resolution PlanetScope imagery, coupled with the convenience of simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) algorithm within the Google Earth Engine (GEE), presents the potential for Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) to map the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets in a complex built-up environment of Durban. Such advances in multi-sensor satellite image inventories on GEE also afford the possibility to integrate data from sensors with different spectral characteristics and spatial resolutions for effective abstraction of informal settlement diversity. The main objective is to exploit Sentinel-1 radar data, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope optical data fusion for more accurate and precise localization of informal settlements using GEOBIA, within GEE. The findings reveal that the Random Forests classification model achieved informal settlement identification accuracy of 87\% (F-score) and overall accuracy of 96\%. An assessment of agreement between observed informal settlement extents and ground truth dimensions was conducted through regression analysis, yielding root mean square log error (RMSLE) = 0.69 and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) = 0.28. The results demonstrate reliability of the classification model in capturing variability of spatial characteristics of informal settlements. The research findings confirm efficacy of combined advantages of GEOBIA within GEE, and integrated datasets for more precise capturing of characteristic morphologic informal settlement features. The outcomes suggest a shift from standard static conventional approaches towards more dynamic, on-demand informal settlement mapping through cloud computing, a powerful analysis platform that simplifies access to and the processing of voluminous data. The study has important implications for identifying the most effective ways to map informal settlements in a complex urban landscape, thus providing a benchmark for other regions with significant landscape heterogeneity.},
